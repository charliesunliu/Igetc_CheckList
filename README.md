# Igetc_CheckList

## What this project does
In all California Community College, students need to complete Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC).
This is a list of general education courses.

First of all I will creat a checklist for De Anza College.
After that, I hope students in other colleges will creat a IGETC check list for their own colleges.
